# RepoSearchApp
This Android application is for searching among GitHub repositories.  
  
__Usage__: Type the expressions you want to search for among the GitHub repositories, select the fields to search with the "Add qualifiers" button and click "Search" to get the results which appear in a list. You can click on each list item to view further details.  
  
I've implemented the application with __Android Studio__ (Hedgehog) using __Jetpack Compose__ for the UI. The data is retrieved from the __GitHub Search API__.
